# SNote

This project, developed for the Mobile Programming Course IT4785E (Semester 20241) at HUST, is a simple note-taking application for Android devices. The application enables users to view, search, create, edit, delete, and synchronize notes through cloud storage.

While similar projects are widely available on platforms like GitHub, this repository stands out by including a detailed report and presentation slides, emphasizing the development process and the knowledge gained throughout the course.
